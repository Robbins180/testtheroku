  This is a small e-commerce store selling off out of season reindeer. Winter is leaving and all the beloved reindeer cannot go with til next year. The home page is built on a simple platform with a rotating carousel and images with a sell price.

  Problems: My middleware caused hours of problems being in the wrong location. This is now fixed and Delete/ Update now works.

  I plan to update the styling on the other pages other than the home where it is a smooth experiance. First Show, then Edit.

  Discount Reindeer uses Node.js , Mongoose, Express, EJS
